## 2 - Transform vertices to fit in window
Firstly, we wanted to be able to apply local and world transformation on the model.
So, we added to `MeshModel` six matrices (SRT):
- Scale Model
- Rotation Model
- Translation Model
- Scale World
- Rotation World
- Translation World

Each one describes the matching transformation.
We added methods to set and apply SRT transformations:

```cpp
	void ApplyModelScale(double scaleX, double scaleY, double scaleZ);
	void ApplyModelRotate(double rotateVal);
	void ApplyModelTranslate(double transX, double transY, double transZ);

	void ApplyWorldScale(double scaleX, double scaleY, double scaleZ);
	void ApplyWorldRotate(double rotateVal);
	void ApplyWorldTranslate(double transX, double transY, double transZ);
```
These methods apply the parameters without depending on the previous values:
```cpp
	void SetModelScale(double scaleX, double scaleY, double scaleZ);
	void SetModelRotate(double rotateVal);
	void SetModelTranslate(double transX, double transY, double transZ);

	void SetWorldScale(double scaleX, double scaleY, double scaleZ);
	void SetWorldRotate(double rotateVal);
	void SetWorldTranslate(double transX, double transY, double transZ);
```
